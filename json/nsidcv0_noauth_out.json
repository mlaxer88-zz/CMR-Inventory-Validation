      "summary" : "This project involves measuring regional and site variability in maximum annual active layer development and vertical surface movement over permafrost, and monitoring sites over time in order to observe trends. The project records maximum thaw penetration, maximum heave and subsidence, late season snow depths, current depth of thaw, elevation, and soil properties. Some sites are twinned with soil- and air-temperature recording equipment.\n\nThe project includes about 60 monitoring stations extending from Fort Simpson, Canada, in the upper Mackenzie River valley to the Beaufort Sea coast at North Head, Richards Island, Canada. Ten of the sites are part of the IPA's Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) Program. CALM site numbers are in parentheses after the site names: North Head (C3), Taglu (C4), Lousy Point (C5), Reindeer Depot (C7), Rengleng River (C8), Mountain River (C9), Norman Wells (C11), Ochre River (C13), Willowlake River (C14), and Fort Simpson (C15). See the CALM Program Web page for geographic coordinates and site history for all CALM sites.\n\nThese data are the property of the people of Canada and the responsibility of the Geological Survey of Canada. If published, adequate acknowledgment is expected. Please contact F. M. Nixon regarding use of the data set or access to the extended data.",

      "summary" : "These data have been collected from an Arctic desert site (latitude 78o57'29N, longitude 12o27'42E), Broeggerhalvoya in  western Spitsbergen, 10 km NW from Ny Alesund, 45 m above sea  level, 2 km from the shore. This is a low relief tip of a bedrock  peninsula covered with several meters of glacial drift and reworked raised beach ridges. The measurements are obtained in the site of well developed patterned ground, sorted polygons, where the influence of plants, including thermal insulation and transpiration, is negligible. The 1985-1986 period was average. Mean annual air temperature was -6.6 C, 0.4 C colder than the long-term (1975-1990) mean, but well within the mean variability. Mean winter air temperature is relatively warm (mean of coldest month, February, is -14.6 C). Annual precipitation was 17 % greater than the ong-term mean (372 mm); however, the number of rain-on-snow events was less (3) than average (5.5). Overall, the reference period is close to long-term averages.  \n \nA program of automated soil temperature recordings was initiated in the summer of 1984, at a patterned ground field site Thermistors were placed approximately 0.1 m apart in an epoxy-filled PVC rod (18 mm outside diameter), buried in the center of a fine-grained domain of a sorted circle, down to 1.14 m below the ground surface. The data presented here covers 7/1/85-7/1/86, once a day (6 am), at two levels (0.0 m, 1.145 m below surface). The resolution of the thermistors is 0.004 C, and the accuracy is estimated to be 0.02 C near 0 C. Missing data accounts for less than 7 %. The gaps are filled with simple average of the beginning and end of the gap values. For a detailed description of the field site and data analysis see Putkonen (1997) and Hallet and Prestrud (1986).  These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "Snow and soil temperature records for January 1988 - May 1996 are presented. Included are snow depth and weight measurements, snow density (calculated), active layer depth in the frost tubes, weight of wet and dried soil samples from unknown depth within the active layer (water content calculated), and soil temperature at the surface (0.05 cm) and to the depths of 3 to 4 meters at 3 sites. The sites are 1) on a road covered by 1 m of gravel underlain by clay; 2) outside a building on piles, (sensors are placed 1 to 2 m from the building wall); and 3) under the building between piles. In addition, air temperature was measured inside the building or between the piles (documentation is not clear on this point.) There are several gaps in temperature measurements (January 1991 to May 1992). These data are presented on the CAPS CD-ROM version 1.0, June 1998.\n\nAir temperature, wind direction, and temperature were measured at 5, 20, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm below the tundra surface at an undisturbed site; and at 5, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 cm, and 3 m and 8 m below the concrete surface of a building. Incoming radiation, outgoing radiation, temperature of the heat flux instrument, global radiation, heat flux, wind speed, wind speed maximum, average wind speed, and temperature inside the building were measured since 1993 with data loggers. All data are recorded for July 1987 - February 1996.",

      "summary" : "This data contains Upward Looking Sonar (ULS) profiles of the underside of the Arctic pack ice along three transects whose total length is 777 nautical miles. The data were obtained by the USS Gurnard (SSN-662), a U.S. Navy submarine, on a traverse of the AIDJEX Main Experiment area in the Beaufort Sea from 07 April 1976 to 10 April 1976. The sea ice thickness derived from the ULS is given in feet.\n\nThe data are in a single ASCII text file: Aidjex_04_1976_uls.txt. The data in this text file are not formatted into columns; all data are presented in one long row separated by spaces. Little is known about the format of the file, so caution should be used when working with the data. NSIDC is providing this data as part of our effort to preserve historical data.  The data file begins with nine values that appear to be header information. These nine values include latitude and longitude values along with other unknown values. After the header, there are approximately 2100 measurements of what NSIDC believes is sea ice thickness in feet, however it is unclear how often these measurements were taken. After these 2100 values, another header of nine values occurs followed again by 2100 measurements. The file continues in this pattern through the remainder of the file. Users with information about the contents of the file are encouraged to contact <a href=\"mailto:nsidc.org\">NSIDC User Services</a>.\n\nTwo supporting documents that provide some background have been scanned and included as PDF files. These are AIDJEX_ULS_background.pdf and AIDJEX_ULS_format.pdf. \n\nThese data are available via FTP. \n\n<strong>Note:</strong> These data are in a raw format with unknown fields and are being provided as is for preservation purposes.

Observations at these low frequencies penetrate deeper into the soil layer. Land surface emissivity estimates for this data set were collected at the following vertically and horizontally polarized (V-pol and H-pol) frequencies: 6.9, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz. Ancillary data used in the analysis, such as surface skin temperature and cloud mask, were obtained from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). Atmospheric properties were obtained from TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) observations to determine the small upwelling and downwelling atmospheric emissions as well as the atmospheric transmission. The data set is in monthly format that is extracted from instantaneous emissivity estimates. Data are stored in HDF4 files and are available via FTP.",

There are two files for each range because the files with \"_noNaN\" in their names contain \"-1000\" as the missing value, and the other files use \"nan\" as the missing value.

The research was performed using the US Coast Guard Polar Star and Polar Sea ice-class ships, which were at the time the world's most powerful non-nuclear icebreakers and the only US ships capable of mid-winter Arctic operations.\n\nThe items in this data set are PDFs of Arctic Marine Transportation reports with embedded data, along with a PDF of the Achievement Record Brochure (Achievement_Record_1979_1984_Brochure.pdf), and JPEG images providing a historical context of the program. The 15 JPEG images and a PDF of accompanying captions (G02196_images_captions.pdf) are located in the images directory. \n\nThe PDF reports, an Executive Summary (Executive_Summary_Arctic_Marine_Transportation_Program.pdf), and the Appendix to the Executive Summary (Executive_Summary_Arctic_Marine_Transportation_Program_Appendix_A_List_of_Reports.pdf) are located in the Arctic_Marine_Transportation_Reports directory. Note that page 33 of the Executive Summary is missing. The Appendix to the Executive Summary contains an index of reports included in this data set. This index lists 64 reports; however, out of these 64, the following reports were never included and their location is unknown: 1, 4, 36, 37, 60, 61, and 62. Also note that reports 35 and 44 come in two parts.\n\nThe data cover the years 1979 to 1986 and were collected from ships in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. Data are available via FTP.\n\nThis data is being provided as is. NOAA@NSIDC believes these data to be of value, but is unable to provide documentation.

From 1893 to 1956, the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) created charts of observed and inferred sea ice extent for each summer month. These charts are based on compiled observations of ice conditions reported by a variable network of national organizations, shore-based observers, scientific expeditions, and ships as detailed in each report; in cases where no observations were available, the lead mapmakers extrapolated further ice cover using their knowledge of ice movement. Except for where direct observations are indicated, caution is advised in using the charts’ ice edge because there is no way to quantify the assumptions used in extrapolating ice edge or the error involved in this method. See the note on reliability for further discussion of potential error. The charts were scanned at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) and are being made available here as a service and in cooperation with DMI and other contributors. In all, there are 266 image files containing 291 images.",

The data set consists of tables of pond coverage and size statistics for 500 m square cells within 10 km square images (image resolution is 1 meter), along with the surface type maps called Image Derived Products (IDPs) from which the pond statistics were derived. A total of 101 images over the three summers and four sites were used for pond statistics, out of a total of 1056 images acquired.

Environmental 'regions', 'sub-regions', 'landscapes' and localities' shown on a landscape map are merged into the nature-protection regions. The map was compiled by interpreting more than 1000 satellite images and aerial photos as well as from analysis of field data from several institutions. Dominating components of the landscape, composition of the surface deposits, geocryological conditions and natural protection of ground water were considered while distinguishing the Nature-Protection Regions within the limits of Environmental Regions (Melnikov, 1988). The map is supplied with relevant databases, containing the following information - number of regions and landscape type; category of resiliency; category of the ground water protection; vegetation type; geological and geocryological structure to the depth of 10-15 m; ice content (of lenses and of macro-inclusions separately); thickness of seasonally frozen and seasonally thawed layers; ground temperature; contemporary exogenic geological (periglacial) processes; and the area affected by these processes.\n\nThe 55 nature-protection regions of Yamal Peninsula generalize information. To approve the ranges of geocryological and cryolithological characteristics, 160 boreholes were retrieved out of the database containing more than 4000 boreholes data obtained in 1977-1990 by Fundamentproekt Design Institute (Moscow, Russia; PI - Dr.sci.M.A.Minkin) at Kharasavey and Bovanenkovo gas fields and along the pipelines Yamal-Ukhta and Yamal-Uzhgorod. The boreholes have reference to geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), as well as to the nature-protection region numbers shown on the Index Map. A total of 21 units are covered by borehole data, 5-8 boreholes in each unit, covering most typical conditions\n\nThe original database consisted of 3 relational tables. The first table includes category of resiliency; locality type description; landscape type description; ground-ice content, water saturation, cryogenic structure, macro-ground-ice content; vegetation types; seasonally frozen and seasonally thawed layer depths; ground temperature at 10 m; exogenic geological\n processes an their paragenesis and combinations; and degree of the surface disturbance. The second relational table contains layer-by-layer description of the lithological section types. The third table for the boreholes includes the description of topography around the borehole; types of geological profiles through the active layer and depths down to the permafrost table; ground temperature at 10-m depth (close to the depth of zero annual amplitude in the area); macro-ice content; and salinity of permafrost. These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "The methods utilized by the U.S. Geological Survey to measure subsurface temperatures have evolved considerably over the years. Although some of the early measurements were obtained using thermistor strings frozen into permafrost, the vast majority of the measurements were made in fluid-filled holes using a custom temperature sensor. A typical sensor used in Alaska prior to 1989 consisted of a series-parallel network of 20 thermistors; see Sass et al. [1971] for a more detailed description. During a logging experiment, the resistance of the thermistor network was determined using a Wheatstone bridge prior to 1967. After that time, a 4-wire resistance measurement was made using a commercial 5.5-digit multimeter (DMM). Before 1984, boreholes were logged in the 'incremental' or 'stop-and-go' modes; the vertical spacing of the measurements was typically 3-15 m. Beginning in 1984, the depth/resistance measurements were automatically stored on magnetic tape, allowing boreholes to be logged in the 'continuous' mode; the typical data spacing for the continuous temperature logs was 0.3 m (1 ft). Many of the Alaskan boreholes were re-logged several times to quantify the thermal disturbance caused by drilling the holes (see Lachenbruch and Brewer [1959]). A review of current temperature measuring techniques used by the USGS in the polar regions is given by Clow et al. [1996]. Data from 1950-1989 are included on the CAPS CD-ROM Version 1.0, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "This dataset includes observations of the permafrost temperatures in the Inner Tien Shan were started in 1986 by Kazakhstan Alpine Permafrost Laboratory. Observations are carried out on more than 40 boreholes, at altitudes between 3300-4200 m. The depths of the boreholes vary from 30 to 600 m. The boreholes are located in both loose (moraines) sediments and bedrock. Several boreholes are situated in the territory of the 'Kumtor' goldmine. The geocryological conditions of goldmine 'Kumtor' and nearby territory have been discussed in scientific reports 1988, 1989 and articles (see references). Two boreholes were drilled in body of glacier 'Davydov' and located in the central and lateral parts of the glacier (depth - 30 m). A third borehole passed through the glacier, moraine and bedrock to a depth of 600 m. In the Kumtor and Taragai valleys, permafrost temperature in 14 boreholes from 25 to 50 m depth, between 3300-3750 m ASL were observed. The distance between outermost boreholes is about 40 km.\n\nTemperature measurements in 9 geological prospecting adits [tunnels] (lengthwise 1500-1900 m) located in the four neighboring valleys (altitudes from 3920 to 4010 m) were carried out. At the same sites, but in natural conditions, the thermal conductivity of the bedrock was determined by the cylindrical sounding method. Grain size, soil moisture content, cryogenic structure and depth of seasonal thaw were also obtained from 15 pits located in differing altitudinal levels and exposures. At two further sites, ground temperatures measurements at depths of 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 40 cm were taken every hour during daylight hours every 5 days over a two year period. Air temperature, wind velocity and duration of daylight were measured at the same time as the ground temperature measurements. These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "Precision temperature measurements have been made in some 150 deep wells and holes drilled in the course of natural resource exploration in the permafrost regions of Northern Canada. In most cases, holes were logged by lowering a probe containing a regions of Northern Canada. In most cases, holes were logged by lowering a probe containing a thermistor incrementally down the well, in other cases multi-thermistor cables were left in the holes and periodic measurements taken. In the 1990's, a few holes were logged by a automatic quasi- continuous logging system. Most holes were logged annually for 5-10 years after drilling completion, and measured temperatures show the disturbance due to drilling and the gradual recovery to near-undisturbed conditions. Some holes in the collection are of depth less than 125 m. Permafrost thicknesses are estimated at each well or hole from the depth of the 0 degree Celsius isotherm. This data collection provides the highest quality of permafrost temperature and permafrost thickness information available for Northern Canada. Other data are the large number of downhole temperature and permafrost thickness estimates taken during commercial well logging of petroleum exploration wells, and are by nature of lesser quality. These data are not included in this data set, but references to compilations of this data are provided. A short text (2000 words), tables of site locations and permafrost thicknesses with small-scale maps, and an extensive bibliography accompany the data collection. The file structure and contents of each file are well described.

The 122 boreholes were used to derive a characterization of the Russian territory according to eight geocryological regions. Five boreholes are included for Mongolia. Data from these boreholes were used in the generation of the Circum-arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground-Ice Conditions (Brown et al., 1997). Data obtained from various sources as noted within each borehole entry. The time period varies for each borehole, but is primarily from the late 1980s to early 1990s. Observation methods include 'Standard logging', a combined natural gamma logging, electric logging and well caliper logging; 'Geothermal observations' which demonstrate the thickness of layer with the temperature below zero (data of Yakutsk Permafrost Institute, Siberian Branch, Academy of Sciences of the USSR); visual observations on ice-content in the core, and depth of appearance of fresh water table; thermologging of the boreholes (studies of 'PGO Yakutskgeologia'); and electric, well caliper and thermal logging in pioneer and exploratory oil and gas wells ('PGO Lenaneftegasgeologia' studies). The permafrost base is exposed by a number of adjacent boreholes; interval of fluctuations of permafrost depth is shown. The data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "The CALM network includes 168 active sites in both hemispheres with 15 participating countries. This network represents the only coordinated and standardized program of observations using standard measurement protocols designed to observe and detect decadal changes in the dynamics of seasonal thawing and freezing in high-latitude soils. The Intellectual Merit of this study lies in the need for long-term time series of active layer depth, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions in order to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models.\n\nThe active layer thickness is measured by physical probing on grids ranging in size from 100 to 1000 meters, by probing at a single point or along transects or from permanently installed frost tubes and soil temperature cables. Sites include several coastal to inland transects in North America, a longitudinal array of sites across Eurasia, and individual sites in several mid-latitude, mountainous regions. The majority of the sites are in arctic tundra regions consisting of fine grained sediments. Bouldery and rocky sites in mountains are being added to the network primarily in Europe as part of the EC Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE) project. CALM is being considered as the part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). \n\nCALM is closely affiliated with the International Permafrost Association (IPA), several IPA working groups, and the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The current protocol for observing the active layer thickness is given in the published ITEX Manual and on the ITEX and IPA Web sites. These activities are part of the IPA Global Geocryological Database (GGD). \n\nA map on the CAPS CD-ROM illustrates the locations of the 130 sites. A comprehensive metadata file for all sites is available. The CAPS CD-ROM contains detailed metadata and summary data and can be ordered from the Order Data Button and the data can be obtained from the Order External Data Button.",

These data are comprised of surface-climate measurements, including solar time, wind speed, wind direction, dry-bulb, wet-bulb, and vapor pressure in 24 sites focused at the three Northern Canadian locations. The sites were chosen to include a variety of terrains in the study: sedge fen wetland, willow-birch wetland, lichen-heath, bedrock boulders/heath, spruce- tamarack forest, tundra lake, creek, various (e.g. a basin: sedge, willow, lichen-heath, forest, etc.), sparse vegetation (short grass/sedge, heath spp.), and coastal marsh (tall grass, sandy soils). The measurements were taken in increments ranging from seasonally to every 15 minutes. In all, 177 different variables were measured and recorded. The data are valuable due to their unique and consistent nature.",

There is a large, increasing interest in the potential arising from the combination of active and passive microwave data for the extraction of geophysical parameters from spaceborne platforms. Often, one of the major obstacles is the generation of spatially and temporally co-registered data sets for testing hypotheses, validating models, and developing retrieval approaches.

      "summary" : "U.S. pedon data on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998, are a sample of the pedon data contained on a CD-ROM produced by the National Soil Survey Center - Soil Survey Laboratory(NSSC-SSL). The data include recent pedons from analyses for soil characterization and research within the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Less-than-complete characterization data are available for many pedons because only selected measurements were planned or because the planned measurements are not yet complete. This database is dynamic-- data for additional pedons are added as they are sampled and analyzed, other information is updated as pedons are classified, suspect measurements are rerun and replaced, and errors are found and corrected. The data on the NSSC-SSL CD-ROM represent a 'snapshot' of the database. The database includes pedons that represent the central concept of a soil series, pedons that represent the central concept of a map unit but not of a series, and pedons sampled to bracket a range of properties within a series or landscape. Thus, attribute data for some data elements may be incomplete or missing for certain portions of the United States. In instances where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from the analysis. For research purposes, all data are retained in the database. Users unfamiliar with a given soil or set of data may want to consult with a research soil scientist at the National Soil Survey Center. A research soil scientist can be reached by telephone at (402) 437-5006, or by writing the Soil Survey Laboratory Head, National Soil Survey Center, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Federal Building, Room 152, 100 Centennial Mall North, Lincoln, NE 68508-3866 USA.

Air temperatures were recorded between 1 and 5 meters. The data consist of 28 comma-delimited ASCII text files, and are available via ftp. Data files for each site contain slightly different meteorological parameters. This data set is a subset of the more comprehensive data set, Monitoring and Manipulation of Tundra Response to Climate Change, Arctic LTER, Toolik Lake, Alaska. \n\nThe research project was funded by the Arctic System Sciences (ARCSS) Program, grant number OPP-9810222.",

      "summary" : "The Digital SAR Mosaic and Elevation Map of the Greenland Ice Sheet CD-ROM combines the most detailed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image mosaic available with the best current digital elevation model. The mosaic image shows both the location of the ice edge and the distribution of melt-related 'scatterers' on the surface. These scatterers include ice lenses and complex layered structure in the percolation zone and bare ice of the ablation zone.  Other melt-related features that can be seen include lake and surface meltwater stream channels at lower elevations, as well as ice-marginal lakes.\n\nThis characterization of the ice sheet provides a reference against which future change can be measured. Changing conditions resulting from climatic variation should show up as changes in the ice margin and shifts in the hydrologic zones. It is hoped that the standard reference provided by this data set can facilitate activities aimed at change detection and promote other work aimed at understanding the processes operating on the ice sheet.\n\nThe image data are derived from SAR image swaths acquired by the ERS-1 satellite during August of 1992. The mosaic was assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Its component images are a copyrighted product of the European Space Agency. The mosaic, a value-added derived product, is available to individuals and non-profit organizations for research oriented purposes only. The Danish geodetic and cadastral agency Kort-og Matrikelstyrelsen (KMS) compiled the elevation data provided with the product from a number of sources, including field surveys, aerial photographs, and the ERS-1 radar altimeter. The elevation data are also provided only to individuals and non-profit organizations for research oriented purposes. Included with the data is NSIDC's limb (large image map browser) software, which was developed in-house and allows UNIX users to easily select and view portions of the mosaic image with elevation contours derived from the elevation data overlain. Limb is provided as 'freeware' for general use. NSIDC distributes the Digital SAR Mosaic and Elevation Map of the Greenland Ice Sheet on CD-ROM at no charge.",

      "summary" : "This data set contains enhanced-resolution brightness temperatures produced using the Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) algorithm developed by the Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University (BYU). Enhanced-resolution brightness temperature images for the Arctic and Antarctic were generated using antenna temperature data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instrument. SSM/I images are available for 1995 through 2008, and AMSR-E images are available for 2002 through 2010. All available measurements for a single day are averaged into twice-daily gridded files for three different equal-area spatial coverages: Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and full global. The spatial resolution is 12.5 km for SSM/I channels 19 and 22 GHz, 7.5 km for 37 GHz, and 2.5 km for the 85 GHz channel. For AMSR-E, the resolution is 12.5 km for the 6, 10, 18, and 23 GHz channels; 7.5 km for the 36 GHz channel; and 2.5 km for the 89 GHz channel. Software for reading the SIR-formatted SSM/I and AMSR-E data is also available. As scatterometer and radiometer data complement each other, these enhanced-resolution radiometer data, together with SIR format scatterometer data available from BYU, will facilitate polar research that combines information from both radiometers and scatterometers. Data are stored as scaled 2-byte integers in binary arrays with a 512-byte header and are available via FTP.",

      "summary" : "The Environmental Working Group (EWG) was established in June 1995 under the framework of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. In January 1996, the EWG Arctic Climatology Group took on the task of compiling digital data on arctic regions to expand scientific understanding of the Arctic. This work resulted in a set of three atlases on arctic oceanography, sea ice, and meteorology. These atlases are distributed via FTP.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Atlas of the Arctic Ocean was developed by specialists from the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan with Russian and U.S. partners. The Atlas consist of separate volumes for winter and summer, with the following file names G01961a and G01961b respectively. More than 1.3 million individual temperature and salinity observations collected from Russian and western drifting stations, ice breakers, and airborne expeditions were used to develop the products contained in the winter volume. \n\nThe primary products of the Atlas are gridded mean fields for decadal periods (1950s,1960s, 1970s, 1980s) of temperature, salinity, density and dynamic height, Atlantic water layer depth, and temperature and salinity profiles and transects. The original individual observations that were used to derive these fields are not provided with the Atlas and are not available. \n\nNote that the Polar Science Center Hydrographic Climatology (PHC) ocean database (version 3.0) is available from the Polar Science Center, Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington. This is a global gridded database with a high quality description of arctic seas achieved by merging data from several sources, including data from the Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Atlas of the Arctic Ocean.  The PHC or later versions may be more suitable for your research. Inquires may be sent to: Michael Steele, Applied Physics Laboratory, 1013 NE 40th Street, Seattle, WA 98105",

The second plate, at a scale of 1:4,500,000, depicts 14 different terrain classifications determined according to elevation, mean annual air temperature, permafrost thickness and thaw depth, and seasonal frozen ground freeze depth. The locations of six specific cryogenic phenomena are also included: perennial frost mounds, icings, thermokarst, cryogenic landslides, solifluction, and cryogenic planation.

      "summary" : "Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international initiative with the goal of repeatedly surveying the world's estimated 200,000 glaciers. GLIMS uses data collected by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument aboard the Terra satellite and the LANDSAT series of satellites, along with historical observations. \n\nThe GLIMS initiative has created a unique glacier inventory, storing information about the extent and rates of change of all the world's mountain glaciers and ice caps. The GLIMS Glacier Database was built up from data contributions from many glaciological institutions, which are managed by Regional Coordinators, who coordinate the production of glacier mapping results for their particular region. The GLIMS Glacier Database provides students, educators, scientists, and the public with reliable glacier data from these analyses. New glacier data are continually being added to the database.\n\nThe GLIMS Glacier Viewer was developed to provide the public with easy access to the GLIMS Glacier Database. This Web application allows users to view and query several thematic layers, including glacier outlines, Regional Coordinator institution locations, the World Glacier Inventory, and more. GLIMS data can be downloaded into a number of GIS-compatible formats, including ESRI Shapefiles, MapInfo tables, Geographic Mark-up Language (GML), and Keyhole Mark-up Language (KML) suitable for viewing in Google Earth.\n\nNote: The citation listed under the \"Citing These Data\" tab is a general citation for the entire GLIMS data collection. If you download data, please use the appropriate citation(s) listed in the file called 'CITATIONS_nnnn.txt', Where: nnnn = a number for the specific GLIMS data you used.",

The data are updated monthly with new images acquired by Landsat 8 that are then paired with older images acquired within 400 days of the new acquisition for the Antarctic ice sheet, 112 days for the Greenland ice sheet, and 96 days for all other glacierized areas. The data are generated by an image correlation algorithm that produces grids of ice displacement referenced to in-image rock outcrops, slow moving ice, or if lacking that, using the satellite's geo-positioning (accurate to +/- 5 m). Velocity vector grids are generated at a sample spacing of 300 m from small sub-images that are either 300 m or 600 m on a side, depending on the region. For example, ice sheet areas are mapped with 600 m x 600 m sub-images, and mountain glaciers are mapped with 300 m x 300 m sub-images. Accuracy of the velocity data varies depending on the time separation between the images, ranging between ~1 m/d per day to 0.02 m/d per day.",

It is derived from passive microwave satellite brightness temperature characteristics using the Cross-Polarized Gradient Ratio (XPGR) of Abdalati and Steffen (1997). It is physically based on the changes in microwave emission characteristics observable in data from the Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instruments when surface snow melts. It is not a direct measure of the snow wetness but rather is a binary indicator of the state of melt of each SMMR and SSM/I pixel on the ice sheet for each day of observation. It is, however, a useful proxy for the amount of melt that occurs on the Greenland ice sheet. The data are provided in a variety of formats including raw data in ASCII format, gridded daily data in binary format, and annual and complete time series climatologies in gridded binary and GeoTIFF format. All data are in a 60 x 109 pixel subset of the standard Northern Hemisphere polar stereographic grid with a 25 km resolution and are available via FTP.",

The notebooks contain data on Greenland snow accumulation, snow temperature, stratigrapy, ice sheet facies, and snow densification. Dr. Benson's notebooks also include a supplementary 1956 snow accumulation study done by the U.S. Air Force. The notebooks have been scanned and put into PDF format. In addition, a compendium of Greenland snow accumulation data, compiled by Dr. Benson in 1986, is included that spans 1911 to 1981. It is in ASCII text format.\n\nDuring a four-year period from 1952 through 1955, Carl Benson, along with many other individuals and several other organizations, dug and studied 146 snow pits and made 288 supplementary snow hardness profiles with a ramsonde instrument along a 1100 mile traverse in Northwest Greenland (Benson 1962). For each exposed pit, temperature, density, ram hardness, and grain size were measured. The data in the notebooks include a listing of all pit locations, a summary matrix of data collected at each station; accumulation data adjusted for Fall 1954 and Fall 1955 reference horizons; average accumulation for all stations; integrated ram hardness (snow density); descriptive stratigraphy, pit profile temperature and density; and pit and core temperature, density, ram hardness, and stratigraphy for each location. Benson's notebooks for 1952 through 1954 were scanned at NSIDC and are available via FTP. As of January 2013, the 1955 notebooks are still in the process of being digitized.

      "summary" : "Soil temperatures were measured with Campbell 107 soil thermistors. Thermistors were placed at 0, 17, 23 (just above the ice-cemented permafrost) and 40 cm depth. To emplace the sensors, first a soil pit was dug to the level of ice-cemented permafrost. Then a hammer drill was used to make a narrow, 15 cm deep hole into the ice-cemented ground. The thermistor was placed into the drill hole. This procedure caused minimal disturbance to the ice-cemented ground. Air temperature and humidity were measured with a Campbell 207 air probe. The temperature on the surface of an outcrop of Beacon sandstone was measured with a T-type thermocouple. Sunlight was measured with a LiCor 200 pyranometer. The sensors were deployed during Jan 1993 but (due to equipment failure) data storage began only on 6 Jan 1994 and was continued until 16 Jan 1995. All temperature sensors were removed after the data collection interval and calibrated in the laboratory. Calibrations were applied using the Steinhart and Hart (1968) representations for the temperature dependence of the thermistor resistance. This was necessary since the instrumental calibration for the 107 thermistor provided by Campbell did not extend below -40C. After correction, the error in the temperature measurement is estimated to be less than 0.2 C and error in the humidity measurement was Campbell 207 RH sensor has high errors for relative humidity values below 15% --- tending to systematically overestimate values by more than 10% humidity. The error in the averaged light measurement is less than 10 W/m2.  All sensors were sampled once every 10 minutes and averages of three measurements were written to final memory every 30 minutes corresponding to 48 recordings each day.   \n\nData are stored in columns of ASCII data; entries are \n1.

      "summary" : "The Hydrologic Outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet data set contains GIS point shapefiles that include 891 observed and potential hydrologic outlets of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as identified by Lewis and Smith (2009), using satellite imagery. There are 460 observed hydrologic outlets that include proglacial streams and rivers emerging from the ice sheet (length scale >1 km), proglacial lakes touching the ice edge or clearly connected to it via streams or rivers (length scale >3 km), and sediment-rich plumes exiting tidewater glaciers into fjords. Also, there are 431 potential hydrologic outlets that include point locations with release of meltwater from fjords without obvious sediment discharge, as well as locations where the ice sheet directly connects to the ocean that cannot be proven to release meltwater.\n\nMeltwater features along the entire edge of the ice sheet were mapped via photo interpretation of GoogleEarth and Landsat ETM+ 15 m panchromatic data. The exact acquisition dates of the imagery are not available; however, owing to the light and relatively snow-free conditions seen in the GoogleEarth and Landsat images, it is presumed that they were taken during the summer season. Neither Landsat or GoogleEarth images were available for a section of ice sheet within the northern Tunu region; therefore, that region was excluded from the study. This excluded area represents approximately 0.9 percent of the ice sheet perimeter. Data are available via FTP, and can be read in any GIS software.

      "summary" : "The Hydrologic Sub-basins of Greenland data set contains Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon shapefiles that include 293 hydrologic sub-basins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as created by Lewis and Smith (2009). Five km Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of ice-surface and bedrock topography (Bamber et al. 2001) were used to estimate the hydraulic potentiometric surface for Greenland, which accounts for the effects of ice overburden pressure, such as hydrostatic pressure, surface topography, and underlying bedrock topography (Paterson 1994). Using the 5 km potentiometric grid, a modeled basin network for Greenland's ice sheet was created using the hydrological tools within ESRI ArcGIS (ArcInfo 9.2). Although the GIS initially generated more than 293 basins, basins less than 100 km2 in size, as well as basins located completely outside of the ice sheet extent, were removed from the data set. Data are available via FTP, and can be read in any GIS software. The following journal article provides documentation for this data set: Lewis, Sarah and Laurence Smith. 2009.

      "summary" : "This film documents the activities that occurred on Drifting Station Alpha in the Arctic Ocean during the International Geophysical Year, 1957 to 1958. The film is narrated by project leader, Norbert Untersteiner, and chronicles the life of the team as they built their camp and set up experiments. Station Alpha was the first long-term scientific base on arctic pack ice operated by a Western country. At the time of its establishment, Russia had already operated six drifting ice camps of this kind. However, due to the strategic importance and sensitivity of the Arctic Basin, little information from these early stations had reached the West. The documentary was filmed and produced by Frans van der Hoeven (Senior Scientist at Station Alpha) and Norbert Untersteiner (Scientific Leader of Station Alpha). Station Alpha drifted in an area of the Arctic ocean located 500 km north of Barrow, Alaska USA from April 1957 to November 1958; the film covers this entire time period. The file is available for download in .mp4 format via FTP.",

      "summary" : "During the planning and implementation of the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007 - 2009, the International Permafrost Association (IPA) coordinated the acquisition of permafrost temperature data under the Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) Project #50. The TSP project goals included the acquisition of standardized temperature measurements (snapshots) from all permafrost regions on Earth, preparation of a global data set, and development of maps of contemporary permafrost temperatures. As a result of the project, networks of boreholes, equipped for long-term permafrost temperature observations, were established and consist of approximately 860 boreholes in both hemispheres with more than 25 participating countries. Approximately 350 of the boreholes were drilled and instrumented during the IPY period under various nationally funded projects. Comparison of the current Mean Annual Ground Temperature (MAGT) and historical data allows participating countries and other users to assess the thermal state of permafrost dynamics over the last several decades. The TSP project also included active layer measurements, many of which are observed annually under the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) project. Future plans are for these networks to become part of an international network of permafrost observatories with data available for monitoring and multidisciplinary research in both polar and non-polar permafrost regions.\n\nThis data set consists of an inventory of these boreholes in two Excel spreadsheets &mdash; one by country (TSP_Borehole_inventory_countries.xls) and one as a composite (TSP_borehole_inventory_composite.xls) for ease in searching. The spreadsheets include the geographic coordinates of the boreholes, elevation, depth of borehole (BH), year drilled, the MAGT, permafrost (PF) thickness, country, responsible person, affiliation, and sponsors. A summary of the number and type of boreholes by country is provided in a PDF document (N_and_S_hemisphere_borehole_summary.pdf), and a high-resolution JPEG image of the borehole locations (TSP_BoreHoles_location_map_highres.jpg) is also included. The inventory lists boreholes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with 790 of the boreholes located in the Northern Hemisphere. The inventory primarily concentrates on measurements from new and existing boreholes from 2007 to 2009. For historical purposes, some boreholes active since the 1980s are included. Boreholes are classified as four different types: surface (SU) &lt;10 m, shallow (SH) 10-25 m, intermediate (IB) 25-125 m, and deep (DB) &gt;125 m according to the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) classification. For Antarctica, the surface boreholes are split into two subclasses: &lt;SU (&lt;2 m) and SU (2-10 m). The TSP is a field component of the <a href=\"http://www.gtnp.org\">Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost</a> (www.gtnp.org).\n\nData from over 500 of these boreholes are presented and discussed in a series of papers in the special IPY - TSP issue of <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc\">Permafrost and Periglacial Processes</a> (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc) that include five regional papers and one synthesis paper.

The map is based on a digital circumpolar Lambert projection map. Polygons have a single attribute (LAND-ID). LAND-ID is an eight-character code that describes the landscape unit. The first two digits code zone, the third and fourth code landscape, the fifth through seventh code lithology, and the eighth codes substrate chemistry. The code is described in detail in an accompanying legend. Large polygons enclosing islands, or continental land areas between major rivers, form the boundaries of many smaller landscape polygons. These large enclosing polygons have LAND-ID values of 0. Some smaller islands (e.g., Zemlya Frantsa) have no codes associated with them. Areas on the far eastern portion of the map also have no code.",

The mosaics were assembled from interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired in 1996, 2000, 2002, and 2006-2012 by various satellites.\n\nSpaceborne SAR acquisitions were provided through generous data grants from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) together with MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the German Aerospace Center (DLR), and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Data acquisitions during the International Polar Year (IPY) are courtesy of the IPY Space Task Group. Post IPY acquisitions are being coordinated through the Polar Space Task Group.\n\nNote: These data are considered provisional pending a review by the MEaSUREs program.

      "summary" : "The instrumentation was installed in June 1988 and was initially maintained by the Arctic Adaptation Division Canadian Climate Centre, Atmospheric Environment Service (CCC/AES) with field support by Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). It consists of a Campbell Scientific CR10 micrologger with meteorological sensors for air temperature an relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar incoming radiation. It also supports a snow depth sensor, an experimental vegetation temperature and four ground temperatures. It is powered by a 25-AH, 12-volt gel cell (a second gel cell was added in 1989) charged by a 10-watt solar panel. Hourly and Daily sampling was carried out. Data have been quality controlled and fully documented (see documentation files accompanying the data). The High Arctic Integrated Research and Monitoring Area (IRMA) of the GSC was established on Fosheim Peninsula to support interdisciplinary studies related to environmental change. Research carried out between 1989 and 1994, had as primary objective to determine relationships between geomorphic processes and climate in order to help predict the potential geologic impact of global change. Establishment of detailed paleoclimatic records for this region has also been considered essential to provide a context for ongoing climate change. Paleoecological studies (records of peat cores, lakes cores, ice cores, sea cores and archeological records) in concert with other methodologies have been used to outline climatic variability (short, middle or long-term variabilities) and are a primary research component in the region. A major compilation of 20 papers has been produced (see Garneau in press) involving 34 participants from government, universities and industry. The synthesis includes the results from studies of modern conditions (climate, flora and fauna), quaternary geology and glacial history, paleoenvironmental records (i.e. ice cores, ocean, lakes, peat, archeological sites), permafrost dynamics and hydrologic systems. Nine appendices complete the document including a comprehensive bibliography and various data series (climate, vegetation, insects, geophysics, plant and arthropod macrofossils and radiocarbon dates) to provide background forfuture projects in the area. These data are on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, and were identified for inclusion through the efforts of Kathy Young, Ph.D. graduate of Department of Geography, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.",

Ancillary products include daily-averaged total sea ice extent in ASCII format. Estimates of sea ice extent were produced from daily-averaged QuikSCAT sigma-0 measurements and extend from 19 July 1999 to 31 December 2009.\n\nQuikSCAT obtains 12 individual radar normalized backscatter (sigma-0) measurements, called slices, for each footprint as it scans over a 1800 km wide swath. Slices are typically 4 to 6 km long by 20 km wide. The summed measurements of the slices are called egg measurements. The effective resolution and shape of each egg measurement is approximately 20 by 30 km, depending on the antenna beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for each day.\n\nThe Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence, and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between sea ice and ocean. Sea ice extent was estimated for both slice and egg images. The nominal pixel resolution of the slice images is 2.225 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 4 km. Egg images have a nominal pixel resolution of 4.45 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 8 to 10 km.\n\nData and browse images are available via FTP, along with C, Fortran, and Interactive Data Language (IDL) tools to read and display the SIR images.",

Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts. This data set is comprised of Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice-chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2007; and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for the entire period of record as well as for 10-year and 5-year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in the 25-km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) binary (.bin) format. The climatologies are also available in ArcGIS geodatabases (.mdb), and GIF format browse files (.gif) are also provided.\n\nNIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration. The record of sea ice concentration from the NIC series is believed to be more accurate than that from passive microwave sensors, especially from the mid-1990s on (see references at the end of this documentation), but it lacks the consistency of some passive microwave time series.",

      "summary" : "The Tanana river in the Interior of Alaska usually freezes over during October and November. The ice continues to grow throughout the winter accumulating an average maximum thickness of about 110 cm, depending\nupon winter weather conditions.\n\nThe Nenana Ice Classic competition began in 1917 when railroad engineers bet a total of 800 dollars, winner takes all, guessing the exact time (month, day, hour, minute) ice on the Tanana River would break up. Each year since then, Alaska residents have guessed at the timing of the river breakup. A tripod, connected to an on-shore clock with a string, is planted in two feet of river ice during river freeze-up in October or November. The following spring, the clock automatically stops when the tripod moves as the ice breaks up. The time on the clock is used as the river ice breakup time.\n\nMany factors influence the river ice breakup, such as air temperature, ice thickness, snow cover, wind, water temperature, and depth of water below the ice. Generally, the Tanana river ice breaks up in late April\nor early May (historically, April 20 to May 20). The time series of Tanana river ice breakup dates can be used to indicate climate change in the region.",

      "summary" : "The data set consists of monthly global snow cover and snow depth derived from Nimbus-7 SMMR data for 1978 through 1987. The SMMR data are interpolated for spatial and temporal gaps, and averaged for display in polar stereographic projection. Maps are based on six-day average brightness temperature data from the middle week of each month. Data are placed into 1/2 degree latitude by 1/2 degree longitude grid cells uniformly subdividing a polar stereographic map according to the geographic coordinates of the center of the radiometers' fields of view.  Overlapping data from separate orbits in the same six-day period are averaged to give a single brightness temperature assumed to be at the cell's center. Oceans and bays are masked so that only microwave data for land areas are displayed.\n\nComparisons of SMMR snow cover maps with previous maps produced by NOAA/NESDIS and US Air Force Global Weather Center indicate that the total snow covered area derived from SMMR is usually about ten percent less than that measured by the earlier products, because passive microwave sensors often can't detect shallow dry snow less than about 5 cm deep. Snow depths are comparable, showing SMMR results to be especially good for uniform snow covered areas such as the Canadian high plains and Russian steppes. Heavily forested and mountainous\nareas tend to mask the microwave snow signatures, and SMMR snow depth\nderivations are less reliable in those areas.\n\nFormerly distributed by NASA/GSFC/NSSDC and NASA Pilot Land Data System (PLDS), these data are now available via ftp from NSIDC.",

      "summary" : "<h5>Note: If necessary, Version 1 can be accessed by contacting the NCDC service desk at <a href=\"mailto:ncdc.orders@noaa.gov\">ncdc.orders@noaa.gov</a>. However, we highly suggest using the <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/data/g02202.html\">latest version</a> of this data set.</h5>\n\nThis data set provides a Climate Data Record (CDR) of sea ice concentration from passive microwave data. It provides a consistent, daily and monthly time series of sea ice concentrations from 09 July 1987 through 31 December 2007 for both the north and south polar regions on a 25 km x 25 km grid. \n\nThe NOAA/NSIDC CDR is based on the recommendations from the National Research Council (NRC) (2004). It is produced from gridded brightness temperatures from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave radiometers: F-8, F-11, and F-13.\n\nThe NOAA/NSIDC CDR sea ice concentrations are an estimate of the fraction of ocean area covered by sea ice that is produced by combining concentration estimates created using two algorithms developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC): the NASA Team algorithm (Cavalieri et al., 1984) and the Bootstrap algorithm (Comiso, 1986). NSIDC applies the individual algorithms to brightness temperature data from Remote Sensing Systems, Inc. (RSS).\n\nThe data are gridded on the NSIDC polar stereographic grid with 25 x 25 km grid cells and are available in netCDF file format. Each file includes four different sea ice concentration variables: a variable with the primary CDR sea ice concentrations created by NSIDC and three variables with sea ice concentrations created by Goddard. \n\nThe three Goddard-produced sea ice concentrations are the Goddard NASA Team algorithm sea ice concentrations, the Goddard Bootstrap sea ice concentrations, and a merged version of the two sea ice concentrations. These Goddard-produced sea ice concentrations are included in the data files for a number of reasons. First, the merged Goddard NASA Team/Bootstrap sea ice concentrations are an ancillary data set that is analogous to the NOAA/NSIDC CDR data but that adds late 1978 through mid 1987 data to the record. A different instrument, the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), was the source for the brightness temperatures from this period. Sea ice concentrations from the extended period are not part of the primary NSIDC-produced CDR record because complete documentation of the SMMR brightness temperature processing method is not available. Second, the separate Goddard NASA Team and Bootstrap sea ice concentrations are provided for reference.\n\nVariables containing standard deviation, quality flags, and projection information are also included in the netCDF files.",

      "summary" : "This data set consists of a geo-referenced digital map and attribute data derived from the publication 'Permafrost map of Alaska'. The map is presented at a scale of 1 to 2,500,000 and shows the correlation of physiographic province to presence of permafrost across the state of Alaska. The digital data were prepared under the U.S. Geological Survey Global Change Program, Land Data Systems - Arctic Land Processes Studies for display and analysis of terrain. The line work was captured by hand digitizing the source map, Ferrians, O.J., 1965, Permafrost map of Alaska - U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Geologic Investigations Map I-445. Scale 1 to 2,500,000. The digital map was assembled and edited in ARC/INFO. The source map projection is polyconic. It is based on the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid with a central meridian of 150 W longitude. The data were geo-referenced from digitizer coordinates to the polyconic projection and then projected into an Albers Equal Area projection. The coastline was taken from the U.S Geological Survey, 1 to 2,000,000 scale Digital Line Graph data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1987). Attributes for the permafrost map were assigned. Metadata documentation was completed in 1996. The map units are closed polygons that are generalized in shape and size. They are defined in terms of their physiographic characteristics and association with permafrost. Each unit differs with respect to all other units and is uniquely identified as follows.\n11 Mountainous Area underlain by continuous permafrost\n12 Mountainous Area underlain by discontinuous permafrost\n13 Mountainous Area underlain by isolated masses of permafrost\n21 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by thick permafrost\n22 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by moderately thick to thin permafrost\n23 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by discontinuous permafrost\n24 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by numerous isolated masses of permafrost\n25 Lowland and Upland Area underlain by isolated masses of permafrost\n26 Lowland and Upland Area generally free of permafrost\n\nUse constraints -  The U.S. Geological Survey should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data.

Analog records are oscilloscope traces and snapshots of Z-mode radar echo sounding data. Originally recorded on paper strip charts, these 16 mm microfilmed records include timing marks from the Airborne Research Data System (ARDS) clock and ice sounding identification numbers (CBD) for correlation with the digital ARDS data.\n\nTechnical University of Denmark echo sounding flights in 1971/72, 1974, 1978 and 1979 produced data for Greenland that are also archived at NSIDC. Data are published tables of latitude/longitude, and surface and bedrock elevation for each data point, and microfiche copies of the strip charts with frame numbers for correlation with the published tables. Digital version of these Danish data have not been provided to NSIDC for archiving, however, the digital data were used to produce Antarctica: Glaciological and Geophysical Folio, (Drewry 1983). \n\nWe do not have a reliable reader for the microfilm. We are storing the microfilm securely until funding becomes available to have it assessed and/or digitized.  Those interested in these analog records should contact the <a href=\"mailto:fetterer@nsidc.org\">NOAA@NSIDC program manager</a>.",

Approximately 25 investigations used in situ measurements and satellite and aircraft remote sensing to study this issue. Measurements include surface elevation and ice thickness change rates from aircraft laser altimetry, shallow to intermediate ice cores (for average accumulation rates and their temporal and spatial variability), velocity around the ice-sheet perimeter at an elevation of about 2000 meters, local ice thickening/thinning rates, and climatological observations from automatic weather stations. Satellite data used include elevation change from radar altimetry; mapping of snow facies and zones of summer melt from passive and active microwave; ice velocities from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and from repeat high-resolution visible and SAR imagery; mapping surface and 10-m temperatures, accumulation rates, and surface albedo from microwave and AVHRR data.\n\nData are available either by FTP or through investigator Web sites.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers monthly climatologies were a primary  data source. For data-sparse areas such as China, Greenland, the Arctic and  Antarctica, special Rand methodologies were used: empirical evaluation of total precipitation, weather source regions, latitude, temperature, terrain and annual   snow depth data. Monthly ice-pack limits from U.S. Navy Oceanographic Office were used to extend the zero snow accumulation line over the oceans. These mean monthly data can be used strictly as a climatological summary or for systematic  comparison with simulations from any general circulation model (GCM), or for  initiating GCM calculations. Data report copies are also available. The global  grid is too coarse to pick up snow accumulation in Africa and South America, but no more than two grid points are involved in these areas.",

Brown (2000) describes the method, which is considered to be more robust than SCE reconstruction based on statistical methods (see Brown, 1997; Frei et al., 1999).\n\nIn addition, the data set contains time series of annual variation in areally-averaged monthly snow depth and (SWE) for the North American grid domain used to derive the snow cover index.

It is characterized by a transitional climate between the wet Prealpes (precipitations = 1500 mm per year at 1000 m asl) and the central part of Valais (750 mm per year at 1000 m asl) and a contrasted morphology, with high limestone cliffs alternating with schists.

      "summary" : "A complete inventory of rock glaciers on mainland Norway and Svalbard has only been carried out in connection with coarse geomorphological mapping. The data presented here are therefore averaged on a regional scale. Some detailed geomorpholgical maps exist, however, where more detailed information can be extracted. The data listed are therefore not a complete database of Norwegian rock glaciers. Recently detailed studies have been carried out on rockglaciers in the Ny Alesund and the Longyearbyen areas on Svalbard. From these studies, detailed data are available.\n\nOn mainland Norway, there are at least 150 rock glaciers (Sollid and Sorbel 1992) . These may be grouped as follows:\n1. Probably active rock glaciers in high mountain areas in southern and northern Norway. Most of these are situated in the Rondane mountain area of southern Norway.\n2. Relict rock glaciers in low-lying areas near the coast of northern Norway. These rock glaciers have a position marginal to the Weichselian ice sheet and were formed during permafrost conditions before or during deglaciation.\n3. Relict rock glaciers in higher inland areas of northern Norway. These rock glaciers are believed to have formed under permafrost conditions during deglaciation possibly because of rock falls caused by tectonic activity during isostatic uplift. On Svalbard, there are at least 500 rock glaciers (Kristiansen and Sollid 1986). Most of these are situated on the central and western part of Spitsbergen. They are most common in coastal areas, often below the steep escarpment which delimits the inner part of the strandflat. As Svalbard has continuous permafrost, most of these are probably active. Some may however be inactive, as for instance the rock glaciers at Stuphallet near Ny Alesund (Sollid and Sorbel 1992). In those cases, the rock glaciers have moved out of its source area and onto the strandflat. \n\nPartly in cooperation with ETH-Zurich, detailed investigations have been started in the Ny Alesund area, Western Spitsbergen. These investigations have been enlarged also to the Longyearbyen area, central Spitsbergen. Principal methods have been velocity measurements, using theodolite/EDM, GPS and photogrammetry; geophysical methods (DC resistivity soundings, seismic refraction soundings, gravimetry and georadar); and morphometrical analysis using a Digital Elevation Model and a grid-based GIS. Typical velocities are between 5 and 10 cm/year, both for lobate and tongue-shaped rock glaciers. These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "Besides their thermal and mechanical properties, rock glaciers are essentially defined by their kinematics. Knowledge of the permafrost flow field provides important information about the origin, morphology, development, dynamics and internal structure of creeping mountain permafrost. Monitoring permafrost behavior helps detecting climate signals.\n\nAerial photogrammetry was used for determining digital terrain models (DTM) with high resolution. The differences of multitemporal DTMs of a rock glacier provide the vertical changes of the permafrost surface. Horizontal surface displacements were obtained by simultaneously comparing two aerial photographs taken at different times and from different positions (Kaeaeb 1996a,b; Kaeaeb et al.1998). Repeated overridings by the nearby glacier affected the upper part of the Gruben rock glacier, Wallis. Compared to the lower, periglacial part of the rock glacier the higher surface lowering rates of the debris-covered dead ice remains indicate the dead ice being out of equilibrium. Due to different internal structure and different slopes, horizontal surface velocities show different creep directions as well as different creep rates. The rock glacier advances by about 12 cm/a. A 25-year time series of photogrammetrical monitoring (1970-1995) documents the temporal variations of surface kinematics of the rock glacier (Kaeaeb et al. 1998a).  Surface kinematics of Muragl rock glacier (Upper Engadin) over the period from 1981 to 1994 reveal this rock glacier to be a complex system of several individual streams. Changes in elevation show a pattern of zones of surface heave and subsidence in the range of +- 10 cm/a. The rock glacier advances by about 5 cm/a (Kaeaeb 1998). The velocity field 1987-1996 at the surface of Murtel rock glacier, Upper Engadin, points to two dynamically different parts of the creeping permafrost-- (1) high activity and transverse ridges in the inner part and (2) lower activity at the left and right margins. The ridges are advected down stream with a velocity approximately equal to the surface velocity. Stream lines can be interpolated from the surface velocity field. The curvature of the isochrones on Murtel rock glacier is similar to the curvature of the transverse ridges, which suggests slow changes in the flow field (Kaeaeb 1998, Kaeaeb et al. 1998b). These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "This study and inventory of active rock glaciers was carried out by means of the usual techniques used in the study of alpine permafrost. First, the rock glaciers were located by means of aerial photography and field work. Second, a detailed geomorphological map was prepared, to detect the active processes in each rock glacier. This includes geotransect and surface analysis (clast roundness, clast forms, particle orientation and lichenometric measurements). Third, complementary measurements (water temperature and BTS [bottom temperature of snow] measurements) were carried out. These three studies allowed us to determine the activity or inactivity of previously detailed landforms, and to classify them as active, inactive, or relict rock glaciers. The external landforms, frontal slope, vertical organization, flow forms, absence of lichens and the descriptive parameters of rock glaciers allowed us to classify them as relict or active ones.  On the Besiberri, Gemelos, and Argualas rock glaciers we have carried out photogrammetric studies, and on the Argualas rock glacier we carried out a topographic survey from 1991 and also geoelectric soundings (San Jose et al. 1992; Serrano et al. 1995; Fabre et al. 1995).

      "summary" : "In the South Shetland Islands the investigators found eight active rock glaciers, no relict or fossil examples, and seven protalus ramparts. The rock glaciers are located on peninsulas and capes of the two main islands of the archipelago: King George and Livingston. The South Shetland Islands have a cold oceanic climate, characteristic of the maritime Antarctica, with frequent summer rains and moderate thermal amplitude, and a cold and humid morphoclimatic system, of crionival character. These climatic parameters facilitate the operation of periglacial processes, and the presence of a usually saturated active layer in summer. In the South Shetland Islands the presence of rock glaciers have been identified on Livingston Island (Martinez de Pison et al., 1991; Lopez-Martinez et al., 1992a, 1992b), on Admiralty Bay, in King George Island (Birkenmajer, 1981; Barsch et al., 1985) and in Fildes Peninsula (Barsch et al. 1985; Barsch, 1996; Cheng et al., 1996). Four further active rock glaciers have been identified during the present study in King George and Livingston Island (Serrano and Lopez-Martinez, in prep.). The rock glaciers are located in marginal zones, between 300 m asl and sea level, which has been recently deglaciated, and principally under 70 m asl, near 100 m under the Median Equilibrium Line Altitude (MELA). There are indications of a recent diminution of activity, with blurred fronts, mass movements in fronts and sides, lichen colonization and glaciokarstic processes. All of these indicate an inherited dynamic of past conditions in lower altitudes.\n\nReferences to rock glaciers are scarce in Antarctica, limited to a few examples in the Transantarctic Mountains, Victoria Land, South Georgia, James Ross Island, and South Shetland Islands. The spatial pattern of rock glaciers indicates that they are more represented in the periphery of Antarctica than in the interior of the continent, and are particularly numerous in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

      "summary" : "The Austrian Alps are part of the Eastern Alps which consist of three main mountain ranges. The Northern Alps as well as the Southern Alps are predominantly built of limestone and have poor glaciation in spite of high amounts of precipitation (2000-3000 mm/a) due to the fact that they reach elevations of not more than 3000 m. In contrast the Central Alps consist of metamorphic rocks and receive less precipitation, but are glaciated on large areas (highest mountain of Austria: Groglockner, 3797 m). Recent permafrost and rock glaciers are best developed in the Central Alps, where discontinuous mountain permafrost occurs above a mean altitude of 2500 m.\n\nRock glaciers were mapped from aerial photographs (different years, most of them 1980-1990) completely covering the area described above. The inventory comprises 1451 rock glaciers with data on their horizontal and vertical position, activity, and morphometric characteristics of each rock glacier. The distinction between active and inactive rock glaciers within the activity class 'intact' was not possible due to the quality of the photographs. Only 19 % of the rock glaciers were classified as intact, while 81 % are relict ones and in most cases of Late Glacial age (a great part of the investigated is situated below present day lower limit of permafrost). In detail the inventory contains information of the following parameters:\n1: River basin\n2: Number of rock glacier according to river basins\n3: Topographic name out of the official map 1:50.000\n4: Mountain group\n5: Number of official map 1:50.000\n6: Number of official aerial photograph map\n7: Exposure (8 classes)\n8: Lower limit of rock glacier (m above sea level)\n9: Maximum length (m, in estimated flow direction)\n10: Maximum width (m)\n11: Activity (2 classes: intact, relict=fossil)\n12: Highest point of the catchment area of the rock glacier\n(m above sea level)\n13: Difference between 12 and 8 (m)\n\nGeographic coordinates of coverage as listed in the GGD inventory are approximate. These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998. The inventory does not include measurements on dynamics of rock glacier permafrost.",

      "summary" : "This inventory has been established from the results of the interpretation of aerial photographs and field work between 1992 and 1994.\n\nThe area investigated covers the entire Bernese Alps (western Switzerland),  about 4200 km2, and is situated between 46 deg 10' and 46 deg 50' N and  7 deg 10' and 8 deg 30' E. The Bernese Alps are one of the main European watersheds, separating the catchment area of the Aare (draining into the North Sea via the Rhine) from that of the Rhone (which flows into the Mediterranean Sea). The lowest points of the study area are situated in the valley floors of the two rivers at about 500 m asl, whereas several summits exceed 4000 m asl (highest point-- Finsteraarhorn, 4273 m asl). The main structure of the Bernese Alps is the crystalline Aar massif striking WSW-ENE and culminating in the western part of the study area. To the north and the west, the massif is covered by thrust nappes consisting of sedimentary rocks mainly of Mesozoic and early Tertiary age (chiefly marine limestones, shales, and sandstones). Their summits are considerably lower (mostly between 2000 and 3500 m asl).\n\nAccording to their geographic situation between 46 deg and 47 deg N, the climate of the Bernese Alps is of temperate character typical for the zone of the westerlies. Because of the their horizontal and vertical extension, the Alps themselves have considerable influence on the climate. Based on climatic criteria, two main realms can be distinguished: the moist and quite oceanic part in the north of the main watershed and the slightly more continental part sloping south to the Rhone. The northern part, exposed to the westerlies, shows maximum precipitation during summer, with quite low variability, whereas the south is somewhat dryer, showing no distinct maximum but higher variability. Accordingly, mean cloudiness is higher in the north. This results in an increase in the height of the mean glacier elevation from about 2500 m asl in the northern part of the Bernese Alps to 2900 m asl in the south. Because of the high precipitation (locally exceeding 4000 mm per year) and their external situation, the Bernese Alps show a lower equilibrium line of the glaciers and are the mountain group showing the heaviest glacierization of the Alps, which leaves little space for periglacial phenomena (both the glacier showing the lowermost front and the largest glacier of the Alps are situated within the study site). However, this does not mean that permafrost is rare in the Bernese Alps; above 3300 m asl, permafrost can be considered as continuous. In fact, the bedrock of many of the higher mountains in the Bernese Alps is perennially frozen. The number of rock glaciers found in the Bernese Alps is relatively small compared with other Alpine regions. Furthermore, the objects are quite small. This can be explained with the stronger glacierization. Modelling shows that permafrost ground amounts to roughly half as much as the glacierized area (subglacial permafrost not included). (Imhof, 1996)  These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "Primary rock glaciers are fed by avalanche chutes. At the El Salto rock glacier, surveys have been undertaken in order to determine the creep rate. Between 1981 and 1986 temperatures at elevations between 3500 and 3600 m were measured in the active layer to a depth of 1 m with a multipoint temperature recorder (Grant). On the basis of these measurement Buk (1983) determined that the permafrost table was at a depth of about 3 m and the base of the permafrost at 68 m. Similar conclusions were reached by Barsch and King (1989). As an illustration of the importance of avalanches to these forms, the base camp there was destroyed by an avalanche in November 1983. \n\nThe surface of the basin of Morenas Coloradas is 54 square km, of which 10.4 square km is seasonally frozen ground. The remaining 60% of the surface is typically periglacial with rock glaciers as the most important forms. In the glacigenic rock glacier, the clean glacier ice ends in detritus-covered or morainic tongues which result in glacigenic ice being incorporated within the substrate. In this way, ice persists at lower altitudes and under very arid conditions (Lliboutry, 1986; Garleff and Stingl, 1986; Schrott, 1992). Interconnected rock glaciers are generated which undergo different phases of activity not always in agreement with those expected as a resulted of their elevations. That is, they continue to show signs of activity not only at the height of the present 0 degrees C air isotherm, but at lower elevations. In the last step downwards towards the valleys these rock glaciers become inactive, and finally morphologically relict or fossil rock glaciers are found. Meteorological, hydrological and geophysical measurements as well as 5 drillings to a depth of 5 m have been carried out in Morenas Coloradas. At an elevation of 3560 m the temperature oscillates around 0 degrees C (with a maximum variation of 0.5 degrees C) at depths between 4 and 5 m. The annual precipitation (1991-93) is 630 mm and the mean annual temperature is 1.6 degrees C. Using a calculated lapse rate of 0.52 degrees C per 100 m, the 0 degrees C isotherm occurs at approximately 3860 m, which represents a considerable rise in comparison with earlier years. It is assumed that this value is strongly influenced by climate warming in the 1980s and 1990s. Temperatures measured at different depths in Morenas Coloradas at 3560 m are positively correlated with the discharge of Rio Vallecitos (correlation coefficients of 0.8-0.9; significance p=0.01). There is no correlation with snowfall data, however, because of the influence of the 'zonda', a very dry and warm wind (up to 100 km/h) which impedes the accumulation of snow. Between 1978 and 1979, the zonda was active for more than 1000 hours. Discharge from the basin is of good quality and averages 505 l/s with a range from 230 l/s (early spring) to >1000 l/s (summer). In comparison, Schrott (1994) calculated the discharge of a rock glacier in the arid region of San Juan, Argentina to be only 5-8 l/s. These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "Disko Island (8600 km2) is situated west of central  mainland Greenland. The island is part of the Tertiary volcanic province of West Greenland and is mainly made up by lavas. The landscape is a plateau basalt landscape with cirque carved lava plateaus and U-shaped valleys and fjords. Rock glaciers are frequent in Disko Island (Humlum, 1982). In southern Disko Island, about 60 km SSE of the two study sites, meteorological observations have been carried out since 1923 in the village of Godhavn. The present (1961-1990) mean annual air temperature is -3.9 C, the coldest month is March (-15.1 C), and July is the warmest month (7.1 C). The mean annual precipitation at Godhavn is about 400 mm water equivalent. Most of the precipitation (75 %) usually falls during the period June to December, associated with advection of moist, maritime air masses from the south and southwest along the Davis Strait. The remaining part of the year is comparatively dry, as it is dominated by cold and dry katabatic air masses flowing off the Greenland Ice Sheet to the east. Approximately 60-70 % of the mean annual precipitation is snow and in Godhavn a persistent snow cover is registered from late September to late May.\n\nNo systematic mapping of permafrost or permafrost related terrain features have been carried out in this part of West Greenland. Weidick (1968), however, places Disko Island within the zone of continuous permafrost. This is supported by the occurrence of open system pingos (Christiansen, 1995) and numerous rock glaciers (Humlum, 1982, 1984, 1988a, 1988b, 1996; Humlum et al., 1995; Rasch et al. 1996), which are geomorphic indications of the presence of widespread permafrost in Disko Island. Adopting a standard continental geothermal gradient of about 0.033 C m-1, the mean annual air temperature of -7.5 C (1991-96) indicates a potential permafrost thickness of about 175-225 m. This estimate is presumably somewhat conservative, as the Little Ice Age annual air temperature presumably was about 2C below modern values (Humlum, 1996), which would provide conditions for a somewhat thicker permafrost layer than is suggested by modern meteorological values. The high frequency of rock glaciers on Disko Island is presumably derived from high rock weathering rates (Humlum, 1992). These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June\n1998.",

      "summary" : "The Entremont area is 300 square km wide and located in the western part of the Swiss Alps between the Mont-Blanc Massif and the Valaisian Alps, slightly north of the main crest of the alpine range. Altitude varies between 4313 m above see level (asl) at the top of the Grand-Combin and 714 m asl for the outlet of the valleys system. The geological composition is essentially dominated by metamorphic rocks (gneiss, shale, quartzite), however some sedimentary layers (limestone, dolomite) are inserted. The mean annual air temperature is about 0 C at 2300 m asl and annual precipitation among ranges between 1000 and 1500 mm at 2000 m asl with a maximum value of about 2000 mm on the alpine crest (Grand-St-Bernard pass). Equilibrium line of glaciers is over 3000 m asl in the north-facing slopes, the timberline is at about 2100 m asl and permafrost creeping features exist between 2000 and 3000 m asl, what results in a great variety of mountain and morphological landscapes.\n\nAerial photographs analyses and field morphological observations have been performed during summer 1995 in order to inventory and map (1 to 25000) 321 well-developed to embryonic rock glaciers and protalus lobes (coexisting features have been separated) of total area 10.4 square. km. Rock glacier activity classification results from interpretation of both geomorphological and environmental signs. Some geophysics (BTS measurements and DC resistivity soundings) have been performed between 1995 and 1997 on a few rock glaciers in order to confirm the initial interpretation. Data described in this file on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998, are--\n1. Location (X, Y)-- Swiss coordinates near the center of the feature.\n2.

      "summary" : "The investigated region is called Upper Engadin and is situated in the Eastern part of the Swiss Alps. The area is characterized by a high situated valley floor with an average altitude of 1700 m asl. This valley has a very smooth slope in the direction from SW to NE and is characterized by the river Inn and some larger lakes (Lake Sils, Lake Silvaplana, Lake Champfer and Lake St. Moritz). At upper most part the valley breaks sharply down to the valley of the Maira river in the Bergell mountains. There were mapped three categories of rock glaciers. 1) 97 active rock glaciers, 2) 47 inactive rock glaciers and 3) 26 fossil or relict rock glaciers. The mapping was performed with infrared aerial photographs taken by the Swiss Federal Office of Cadastral Surveys (Vermessungsdirektion). The scale of the photographs is around 1 to 52000. The data are described in Hoelzle (1989, unpublished). The following parameters of each rock  glacier were measured. Front elevation [m asl], source elevation [m asl], length [m], width [m], front exposition, source exposition, and coordinates [Swiss national system].

      "summary" : "The research area is located along a transect from 18 deg S to 29 deg S in the Chilean Altiplano, the western part of the high intramontane plateau in the Central Andes. This region is located in an extremely arid zone between the tropical and westerly circulation belt. The so-called 'Andean Dry Diagonal' crosses the research area from NW to SE. \n\nOver 120 rock glaciers have been mapped from chosen test sites using aerial photographs. Several rock glaciers were visited in the field to compare the results. From the collected data (height above sea level, exposition, activity, latitude) we tried to conclude (paleo-)climatic implications. The distribution was compared with summer and winter precipitation patterns of the research area. The highest number of observed rock glaciers appears in the north and very south of the transect--18 and 29 deg S. Between 23 and 27 deg S there is a sharp decline in the number of rock glaciers. It coincides with the present-day position of the 'Dry Diagonal' in the Western Andes. Most of the mountains in this section have no rock glaciers, although there is sufficient debris supply available. Focusing on activity, altitude, and latitude of the observed rock glaciers north of 24 deg S, respectively, south of 27 deg S there is a domination of active and inactive rock glaciers in\ncomparison to relict rock glaciers.\n\nOn the other hand, there are no active rock glaciers between 24 and 27 deg S. In this part, relict rock glaciers can lie 800 m higher than the estimated annual 0-degree C isotherm. If we compare rock glacier activity and number with the precipitation pattern of the area we note that the biggest number of active rock glaciers lie in the region with highest precipitation rates. In the driest part of the test area where the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Western Andes there are no active rock glaciers. They can be found in areas with estimated annual precipitation rates of 200 mm and more. Most of the observed rock glaciers lie in ice free cirques. These were probably built up after, or at, the time of a general ice decay. For the northern part between 18 and 24 deg S, we suggest glacier advances during the so-called Tauca-phase at 12,000-8,000 yr BP. The majority of the rock glaciers in this area can only have formed after 8,000 yr BP. In the southern part of the research area at 29 deeg S, we dated a late Holocene glacier advance at 2,600 yr BP, and thus rock glaciers must have formed at the time of the general ice decay after 2,600 yr BP.\n\nThe altitude of active rock glaciers in the Chilean Andes between 18 and 29 deg S corresponds to the trend of the annual degree C isotherm, with a sharp interruption in the driest zone between 24 and 27 deg S. In this part with less than 100 mm precipitation/yr, the annual 0-degree  C isotherm has no control on rock glacier activity -- the observed relict and inactive rock glaciers lie distinctly higher. The driest zone of the research area corresponds with the area with a striking reduction of number of rock glaciers and also coincides with the zone where no active rock glaciers could be found. We conclude that the so-called 'Andean Dry Diagonal' cannot have changed significantly it's position since the time when the rock glaciers were formed, probably in the middle and late Holocene. But we assume an intensification of precipitation to form rock glaciers in the driest part of the research area. These data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

      "summary" : "The Zailiyskiy Alatau is the northernmost parallel latitudinal ranges of the Northern Tien Shan. The highest point of this range is the Talgar peak (4973 m a.s.l.). The central part of the range is strongly glaciated; 380 glaciers of total area about 510 sq. km occur here. There are 504 rock glaciers in the Zailiyskiy Alatau Range. On the morphological signs, 429 of this amount of total area 49.77 sq. km are considered to be active. The best studied rock glaciers are concentrated in the central part of the northern slope of the Zailiyskiy Alatau in basins of the Bolshaya (Big) and Malaya (Small) Almatinka rivers. The investigations of rock glaciers of the Northern Tien Shan started in 1923 by geodetic observations of Russian glaciologist N.N.Palgov near the front of the Gorodetsky rock glacier (Zailiyskiy Alatau). The observations were repeated in 1946, 1960, 1977 and 1994 using the theodolite 2T2 of 1'' accuracy. (Gorbunov et al., 1994). The following parameters of each rock glacier were measured. Location (river basin, geographic extent); Type (morainic/lobate); Activity (active/inactive); Size (length, width), m; Area, sq. km; Orientation; Elevation of the source, m a.s.l.; Elevation of the front, m a.s.l. Since 1975, the investigations of rock glaciers of the Northern Tien Shan are carrying out by the Kazakhstan Alpine Permafrost Laboratory. In order to determine regularities in the distribution of rock glaciers, an inventory using aerial photographs and maps of 1 to 100 000 scale was carried out (Gorbunov, 1979, Titkov, 1988).

      "summary" : "The Sierra Nevada is a tectonic uplift mountain range with a gradual gain in elevation on the west side and a steep escarpment on the east.  Most of the mapped locations are east of the Sierran crest. The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with most of the precipitation in the winter months coming as snow at high elevations, but with some monsoonal precipitation in the summer, particularly in the southern end of the range.   There is a very steep gradient in decreasing precipitation eastward from the Sierran crest as a result of rain-shadow orographic effects from the predominately eastward-moving Pacific frontal storms.  PRISM-estimated (Daly et al. 1994) annual precipitation for the RIF locations ranged from 580 to 1880 mm; July precipitation from 5 to 33 mm.  Mean annual maximum temperatures ranged from 1.8 to 15.2 oC, January from -5.7 to 6.2 oC, and July from 11 to 26.3 oC.  Mean annual minima ranged from -8.1 to -0.4 oC, January from -15 to -7 oC, and July from 1.2 to 8.9 oC.  The highest temperatures and lowest precipitation were largely at relict Pleistocene rock glaciers, which tended to be farthest east of the Sierran crest and lower in elevation. We mapped over 430 RIFs, based on field surveys and grouped them into six classes based on morphology and location. These categories constitute a greater range of frozen-ground features than are commonly described in rock-glacier surveys.  Although granitic substrates dominate the Sierra Nevada, they do not in the eastern escarpment, so substrates in the RIF database are about equally divided between granitic and metamorphic.  Ages of rock glaciers ranged from current (active) to relict (late Pleistocene).  We interpreted the presence of outlet springs, basal lakes, suspended silt in outlet streams, and fringing phreatophytic vegetation, in addition to morphologic indications of current rock movement, as evidence for interstitial ice, either persistent or seasonal.\n\n<br>One comma-delimited ASCII file containing information for 430 rock-ice features is available.",

      "summary" : "The <a href=\"/scicex/\">Submarine Arctic Science Program</a>, SCICEX, is a federal interagency collaboration among the operational Navy, research agencies, and the marine research community to use nuclear-powered submarines for scientific studies of the Arctic Ocean. Unlike surface ships, submarines have the unique ability to operate and take measurements regardless of sea ice cover, weather conditions, and time of year. This allows for a broad and comprehensive investigation of an entire ocean basin. The goal of the program is to acquire comprehensive data about Arctic sea ice, water properties (biological, chemical, and hydrographic), and water depth (bathymetry) to improve our understanding of the Arctic Ocean basin and its role in the Earth's climate system. SCICEX is important because it adds critical pieces to the overall information needed to analyze sea ice and ocean dynamics. Data collection began in 1993 and is on going.",

      "summary" : "The Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St. Petersburg, Russia, produces sea ice charts for safety of navigation in the polar regions and for other operational and scientific purposes. Arctic charts from 1933 through 2006 are collected in this data set. Chart frequency and spatial coverage varies, but charts were compiled every 10 days during the navigation season, and monthly for the rest of the year, over most of the series. There is a gap with no charts from 1993 through 1996. Chart coverage focuses on the Northern Sea Route, although later charts extend into the central Arctic.  The charts were compiled from a variety of data sources, with heavy reliance on regular reconnaissance flights for most of the series until 1992.\n\nEarly paper charts were digitized, and the entire series, including later charts that were produced entirely digitally, were converted to Sea Ice Grid (SIGRID) format at AARI. AARI provided code to read the SIGRID data and convert it to a format close to Equal Area Scalable (EASE)-Grid. NSIDC completed the conversion to EASE-Grid. The EASE-Grid is in a Lambert equal-area projection with 12.5 km cell size. Total ice concentration, as well as partial concentrations for multiyear, first-year, new/young ice (ice younger than first-year ice), and fast ice, are given in EASE-Grid (binary), SIGRID (ASCII), and browse (PNG) files. Data are available via FTP. This data set replaces and updates the previous data set, AARI 10-Day Arctic Ocean EASE-Grid Sea Ice Observations (nsidc-0050, discontinued December 2007), and the Russian Arctic charts on the Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Arctic Sea Ice Atlas (http://nsidc.org/data/g01962.html).\n\nAccess to the data is unrestricted, but users are encouraged to register for the data. Registered users will receive e-mail notification about any product changes.",

The Seasat data were collected for a continuous\n90 days in 1978, at latitudes between 72 degrees South and 72 degrees\nNorth. GEOSAT was launched in 1985 and placed in a nearly identical\norbit to Seasat, also at latitudes of between 72 degrees South and 72\ndegrees North. The orbit was designed to provide high-density\nmeasurements over the Earth's surface, at a maximum grid spacing of 2.7 kilometers at the equator and much denser spacing over polar ice\nsheets. Data were acquired between April 1985 and September 1986.\n\nInitially acquired by the Johns Hopkins APL (Applied Physics Lab)\nsatellite tracking facility, the raw altimetry satellite data from\nSeasat and GEOSAT were passed on to NASA, via the US Navy. NASA\ndeveloped slope correction routines for the higher slopes over the ice\nsheets, relative to ocean surfaces. The data are height profile Level\n3 data and gridded height Level 4 data provided by the Oceans and Ice\nbranch of the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Physics of Goddard Space\nFlight Center. Elevations from the full data rate (i.e., one\nmeasurement every 662.5 m) are provided in georeferenced databases.\nThese elevations are relative to the WGS-84 ellipsoid. Gridded\nelevations at 10-kilometer and 20-kilometer spacing are provided in\nthe gridded data sets created from the GEOSAT and Seasat data,\nrespectively.

      "summary" : "Micro-climatic monitoring of air and ground was started in 1990 to evaluate climatic controls on the present-day diurnal soil frost environment in the Western Cape mountains of South Africa. To this effect two data logger stations were established in the summit region of the Waaihoek mountains. Two sites were established at Waaihoek Peak and Mount Superior, respectively.\n\nWaaihoek Peak - The Waaihoek Peak monitoring site is positioned on the southeast extension of a small summit plateau at 1900m elevation where it changes into a southeast trending ridge flanked by two small valleys. The station stands on a 4 to 5 degree slope with an aspect of 140 degrees and is underlain by steeply dipping quartzitic sandstone of the Peninsula Formation. A shallow sandy soil here reaches a thickness of 0.35m and supports a sparse vegetation cover of Restio (Cape reeds) species up to 0.2m high with a total cover of around 30%. Initially both daily and hourly records were kept which necessitated frequent visits to replace the data storage tapes. As from 29-11-1992 only daily records were kept, including maximum and minimum temperature and 24 hour precipitation totals. Average daily soil moisture levels were recorded only as the range between daily maximum and minium values proved to be minimal.\n\nMount Superior - Field observations established the presence of active soil frost features near Mount Superior during December 1991. A second data logger site was consequently established by 1-5-1993 to provide microclimatic data from a site with a different substrate and currently active soil-frost processes. The Mount Superior station is positioned 5km SSE of the Waaihoek Peak site on a flat summit plateau of Cedarberg shale at 1860m elevation. The surface cover is comprised of fractured bedrock and bare shallow soil with tussocks of Restio spp. up to 0.5m high. Daily maximum and minimum temperature were recorded for each sensor as well as daily average relative soil moisture levels and daily precipitation totals.\n\nThese data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998.",

The observers had frost tubes installed by District personnel in their back yards. The early penetration of frost at the beginning of the freezing season was not observed, but most observers picked up the record when 1 or 2' of frost had occurred. This data base, a preliminary version, was constructed by Richard K.

The data have been compiled into five Microsoft Excel files, one for each station. Each Excel file contains three worksheets: \n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>G02189info</em></strong> worksheet: Contains the same content in each Excel file - lat/lon info and notes on the stations</li>\n<li><strong><em>Jan soil & surface temp</em></strong> worksheet: Contains winter (January) soil temperature and air temperature (except for the Churapcha Excel file that only contains soil temperature - air temperature was not available)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Jul soil & surface temp</em></strong> worksheet: Contains summer (July) soil temperature and air temperature (except for the Churapcha Excel file)</li>\n</ul>\n\nThere are two different versions of the Excel files: a complete version and a subsetted version. Both versions exist for each of the five stations for a total of 10 files. The complete versions of the files reside in the directory called <em>complete</em> and have the word <em>full</em> in their filename. These files contain borehole temperature data at all available standard depths: 0.2 m, 0.4 m, 0.6 m, 0.8 m, 1.2 m, 1.6 m, 2.0 m, 2.4 m, and 3.2 m. The subsetted versions of the files reside in the <em>subset</em> directory and have <em>subset</em> in their filename. These files contain data from the 0.8 m and 3.2 m depths only. Missing data are indicated by the value <em>-999.0</em>. The complete version is more applicable to scientific investigation. The subset version is provided for K-12 teachers and is featured in a classroom activity called <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/frozenground/classroom/permanent_permafrost.html\">\"How Permanent is Permafrost?\"</a>\n\nWe have included air temperature measured at these five stations when it is available. There are two sources for the surface air temperature data: <a href=\"http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds570.0/\">NCAR World Monthly Surface Station Climatology, 1738-cont</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcnm/\">NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) Monthly</a> data set. These two sources both draw on the same single original source: data from the <a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html\">World Meteorological Organization</a> (WMO) station network. The complete files have data from one or both sources, while the subset files only include data from the source with the most complete record. \n\nThese data are being offered as is. NOAA@NSIDC believes these data to be of value but is unable to research and document these data as we do most data sets we publish.",

      "summary" : "The Seasonal Ice Zone Observing Network Local Observations Interface allows access to observations of sea ice, weather, and wildlife collected since 2006 by Indigenous Inupiaq and Yup'ik sea ice experts in several communities along the northern and western coasts of Alaska. The SIZONet web interface provides access to a database of local observations spatially referenced around Alaskan villages. The database brings together two distinct knowledge systems of western science and local and traditional knowledge. As an archive and instruction tool, the interface offers collaborating opportunities for hunters and their communities. Since it is designed to change in response to the evolving nature of the observations, the database provides a framework for researchers to track and compare specific climatic, environmental and ecological features, and events across geographic locations and over time.\n\nThe goal of this project is to preserve and pass on local and traditional knowledge of sea ice and its use knowledge. In documenting local sea ice change, records may offer insight into how that change affects community and cultural activity. Arctic coastal communities have long recognized that sea ice conditions are not what they once were: the ocean is freezing later in the fall and ice is melting earlier in the spring, shore-fast ice is less stable, there is far less thick multiyear ice, and environmental conditions overall are less predictable. \n\nTo view the observations in the database, visitors must agree to the Use Agreement and enter as a Guest. Members of the participating Alaskan communities can log in as a Registered User for a more robust use of the interface.",

      "summary" : "The TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) Polar Pathfinder (Path-P) data set consists of gridded daily and monthly Arctic and Antarctic atmospheric data derived from various NOAA satellites. TOVS Path-P daily files are available for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from 60 degrees poleward at 100 km gridded spatial resolution in an Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid). TOVS Path-P monthly files are available for the Northern Hemisphere only from 60 degrees poleward at 100 km gridded spatial resolution in EASE-Grid. Daily and monthly Northern Hemisphere data are available from January 1979 through current processing, and daily Southern Hemisphere data are available from July 1979 through current processing. Data were created from a modified version of the Improved Initialization Inversion Algorithm (3I) (Chedin et al. 1985), a physical-statistical retrieval method improved for use in identifying geophysical variables in snow- and ice-covered areas (Francis 1994).\n\nVariables retrieved from satellite-observed radiances for this product include atmospheric temperature, water vapor, skin surface temperature, total effective cloud fraction, cloud top pressure and temperature, solar zenith elevation, surface pressure, turning angle between geostrophic wind and surface stress over ice, emissivity, boundary layer stratification, and geostrophic drag coefficient. The algorithm used to generate these grids has been validated through comparisons with surface observations from the North Pole drifting meteorological stations (Schweiger et al. 1999).\n\nThe complete TOVS data set is available via FTP in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). Users may also order subsets of the data for any of the parameters listed above or for specific spatial or temporal coverage. \n\nData users are encouraged to register before accessing the TOVS data. Registered users automatically receive release notes via e-mail containing notification of data manipulation or formatting modifications.",

Two types of data are included: monthly snowfall amounts and monthly snow cover duration in days. The period of record varies with each station, with the longest station record including data from 1877 to 1996. The average station record duration is approximately 61 years. Available stations range from 565 meters to 2720 meters in elevation. The data are summaries of snow stake measurements. Daily observations of total snow depth were generally made at 8 a.m. local time. Data were aquired using a snow measuring rod. Snowfall amount was defined as being any increase over the previous day's reading. This measurement may be an underestimate of as much as 10-20% due to snow pack settlement. However, this underestimation is fairly consistent for all measurements. The daily data were then totaled to yield the monthly values.",

From the perspective of many hunters and elders in the Arctic, \nthe weather has been uggianaqtuq in recent years. In this interactive, multi-media CD-ROM, Inuit from \ntwo communties, Baker Lake (Qamani'tuaq) and Clyde River (Kangiktugaapik) in Nunavut, Canada, share \ntheir observations and perspectives on recent environmental changes. The CD-ROM is a pilot project \nthat uses media technology as an alternative way (as opposed to written reports) to document and communicate Inuit observations and knowledge. Maps, text, photos, video and music are integrated to \nhelp illustrate the changes Inuit have observed in their environment and the impacts on their \nlivelihoods. The integrated components allow the user to search by topic or person; view interview clips \nin Inuktitut with English interpretations; view and print maps about environmental changes drawn by \nparticipants; view short videos with scenes from the communities; view summaries and photos of \nenvironmental changes and their impacts to the landscape and community life. Topics include sea ice, \nsnow, wind, weather variability, changes in seasons, changes in activities, animals, and more.\n\n\nPlease Note: This CD-ROM is Copyright Shari Fox (Gearheard), 2003 (the author).
